#+TITLE Personal Notes for 2016

#+DATE <2016-01-05 Tue>

* John 1:1-17
  - "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." 
    v. 9
    * Christ is the true light. I need to do everything that I can to show that light
      to my family. My wife and soon to be my newborn son. I feel that I need to pray
      and read better the scriptures in order to do this thing for Him and my wife. 
      I want to be a worthy priesthood holder since He will be gaining that soon.
  - My Goals for this year:
    * Pray morning and night on my knees
    * Make at least one insightful comment on my scripture study
    * Hold FHE
    * Attend the Temple at least once a month
