* Questions to ask
  - Where do I need development? 
  - What do I want out of life? 
  - Where do I want to go? 
  - How can I get there?

* Quote from Elder Robert D. Hales
  "Use your agency to develop yourself personally. As you discover your gifts 
  and talents, â€¦ you must let the Spirit guide you. Choose and act for 
  yourself. Be motivated from within. Make a plan for your life, including 
  education or vocational training. Explore interests and skills. Work and 
  become self-reliant. Set goals, overcome mistakes, gain experience, and 
  finish what you begin."

* Four categories for potential self-improvement goals
** Mental

** Physical

** Spiritual

** Social 

* Materials that helped me study and be motiviating
